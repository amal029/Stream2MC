This library implements a number of techniques to extract data and task
parallelism form stream graphs for heterogeneous multi-processor
systems. 


The library includes support for producing ILP to be solved by a solver
such as CPLEX, or produce timed automata to be checked using Uppaal. 
There are also a number of state-space search heuristics that perform
better than optimal solutions, when considering runtime. But, they also
give comparable solutions.
